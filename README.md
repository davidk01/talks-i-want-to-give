# Talks I Want To Give

**Please fork so people can see the great talks _you_ want to give, too!**

## What is this?

It's a list of possible talk ideas that maybe I'd like to give. It's half thinking out loud, and half soliciting feedback and suggestions. 

Publishing your talk ideas has a bunch of awesome benefits! 

- Sometimes you have brilliant ideas. Sometimes there are open CFP's. How often do they overlap? (for me: never)
- Conference organizers can find you through the list of forks and ask them to speak at your conference! 
- If someone wants you as a speaker, they can ask you to speak about a topic you actually like! 
- Sometimes it's hard to see what parts of your own work would make really good talks. Ask your friends and coworkers to write Issues and Pull Requests for awesome talk ideas!

## What do I do with it?

- Jot down your talk ideas as they come up. Never scratch your head at a CFP again!
- Host a brainstorming workshop where people write their own Talks I Want To Give.
- Use Issues, Pull Requests, or plain ol' email to suggest topics to your friends and mentees. Pro tip: even a small invitation goes a long way, particularly for women! 


## My Talk Ideas

### Parser combinators for fun and profit

Pretty much 90% of programming is implementing some kind of model and then acting with computational primitives on that model. So you can either accept that this is what programming is mostly about and leverage some very practical theory developed by some smart people or you can continue munging and transforming everything in an ad-hoc way (*cough* *regexes* *cough*)

(parsing, pattern matching, DSLs)

### Interpreters for fun and profit

Now that you have a domain model what do you do next? Act on it but you again have two choices. You can either leverge some very practical theory or you can transform things in an ad-hoc fashion. The practical theory is the theory and implementation of interpreters and virtual machines and it's all simpler than people realize.

(interpreters, virtual machines)

## Feedback please!

Ideas, suggestion, and honest feedback encouraged. I want to hear which of these ideas resonate, and ideas for making the others better. New ideas particularly welcome. Thanks!
